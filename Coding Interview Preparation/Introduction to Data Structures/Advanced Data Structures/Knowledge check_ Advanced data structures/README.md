### 1. Given an array of 12 numbers `->  1,45,5,34,23,5,82,12,35,21,8,9` and a hashing function modulus `6`. How many collisions would you expect to have in your table?

- [ ] 4.
- [ ] 5.
- [x] 6.
- [ ] 7.

### 2. What data structure would be most suitable for mimicking the actions of a hashtable?

- [ ] Stack.
- [ ] Queue.
- [x] Dictionaries.

### 3. What value is stored at the root of a `min_heap`?

- [ ] The highest value.
- [ ] The last inserted value.
- [x] The lowest value.

### 4. Why is the travelling salesman used in graphs?

- [ ] Because the distance between two nodes reflects distance in real life.
- [ ] Because graphs store information in a fixed way so that every node is the exact same distance apart. Allowing us apply travel times to it.
- [x] Because the analogy of travelling can be related to the number of connected nodes.

### 5. In relation to computer science what is a clique?

- [ ] It is a social group that one actively engages with.
- [x] It is a subset of a graph that has found to have strong internal connections and weak external ones.
- [ ] It is a memory feature that allows for quick lookup of one's social circle.
