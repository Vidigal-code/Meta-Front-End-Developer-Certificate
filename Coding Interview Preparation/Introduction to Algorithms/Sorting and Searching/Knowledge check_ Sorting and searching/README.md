### 1. Given an array of 6 numbers `-> 6, 8, 19, 48, 9, 90` and applying a selection sort. How many swaps must occur before the array is sorted?

- [x] 2.
- [ ] 4.
- [ ] 6.

### 2. Given an array of numbers and a target value, using a loop, what is the worst-case time complexity to check if the number is present in the array?

- [ ] `O(1)`.
- [ ] `O(log n)`.
- [x] `O(n)`.

### 3. A binary search can only be performed on a sorted dataset.

- [x] True.
- [ ] False.

### 4. Given the following snippet of pseudocode:

```
array = []
n = 4
FOR i = 0 TO n:
   FOR j = 0 TO n:
      array.add(i*j)
```

What is the space complexity of this problem?

- [ ] `O(n)`.
- [ ] `O(log n)`.
- [x] `O(n^2)`.

### 5. What advantage is there to changing element location using an in-place swap?

- [x] It reduces the amount of space taken by removing the need to create another variable in memory.
- [ ] It reduces the time taken to complete an algorithm through lowering the time complexity.
- [ ] It is a memory feature that allows many variables to reference the same memory location.
