### 1. What is memoization?

- [x] It is a process of retaining the results from a computation so that they can be reused rather than recalculating a result.
- [ ] It is a practice of only computing what is in the cache in place of expensive memory calls.
- [ ] It is an example of divide and conquer.

### 2. The practice of breaking a problem into a set of overlapping subproblems is referred to as:

- [ ] Divide and conquer.
- [ ] Memoization.
- [x] Dynamic programming.

### 3. Quicksort is an example of divide and conquer?

- [x] True.
- [ ] False.

### 4. A bank robber has entered a bank vault and sees 3 stacks of precious bars: Gold, silver and platinum. The gold weighs 6kg and is valued at 60 dollars. The silver weighs 1 kg and is valued at 5 dollars. And the platinum weighs 10kg and is valued at 110 dollars. The robber can only carry 38kg. What is the optimal combination of items to take? Your solution is to fill the bag with as many platinum bars as possible before moving to the gold and then the silver. What type of approach best describes this solution?

- [ ] Graph approach.
- [x] Greedy approach.
- [ ] Dynamic programming.

### 5. Why is a base case crucial when designing recursive solutions?

- [ ] It is used to ensure that the input diminishes at each call.
- [ ] The algorithm needs to know the shape of the minimum case so it can model the solution from it.
- [x] Without it the function would go on forever.
