- [x] Ask questions.
- [ ] Move the conversation along and try not to draw attention.
- [ ] Ask the interviewer how they would solve the problem.

### 2. During a technical interview, is it better to rely on the work of others, or code everything yourself?

- [ ] Write as much code as you can to show off your skills.
- [x] Use code written by others.
- [ ] Use the data structures, but donâ€™t use any other external implementation.

### 3. Given an array that represents sock colors: `Sock_colors = [3,3,2,1,1,3,5,1,4,2]`, how many pairs of the same color socks exist?

- [ ] 4.
- [ ] 2.
