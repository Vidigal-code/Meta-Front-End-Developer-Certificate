### 1. Given an array that holds 12 integers at 4bytes per integer, contains an additional 12 bytes for the header and 4 bytes for padding. What is the total space complexity for this data structure?

- [ ] 16.
- [ ] 48.
- [x] 64.

### 2. A program requires two arrays to compute a function. First array has a header of 12 bytes, and padding of another 4 bytes. It contains 8 integers of 4 bytes each. The second array also has a header of 12 bytes and 4 bytes padding. The second array contains 24 integers of 4 bytes each. What is the input space of this function?

- [ ] 160.
- [ ] 32.
- [x] 128.

### 3. Changing the values in an array leads to greater space complexity over creating a new array and copying in the values?

- [ ] True.
- [x] False.

### 4. Does reducing the space complexity of a function increase the time complexity?

- [ ] Yes.
- [x] No.

### 5. What does auxiliary space refer to?

- [ ] The space used to store data that the CPU is processing.
- [ ] Virtual memory.
- [x] It is the space required to hold any additional variables used in the computations of an application.
