### Which of the following are good examples of optimizing your code?

- [x] Modularize this code into a function that is callable repeatedly and reuse the code when possible.
- [x] If there are portions of your code that are no longer required as a result of modularizing, or as a result of an avenue of thought that was not completed, remove it.
- [x] To optimize space complexity, you may opt for a solution that does in-place changes over creating a new data structure to house the result.
