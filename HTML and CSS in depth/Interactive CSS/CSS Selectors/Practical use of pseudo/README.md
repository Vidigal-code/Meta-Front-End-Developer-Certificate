### You are developing a web page and want to add effect to links on the page. You use pseudo-classes related to web-link states to do this. But to prevent overwriting one of the rules, you must place them in the following order in the CSS file:

- [ ] `link`, `hover`, `active`, `visited` (LHAV).
- [ ] `active`, `hover`, `visited`, `link` (AHVL).
- [x] `link`, `visited`, `hover`, `active`. (LVHA).
