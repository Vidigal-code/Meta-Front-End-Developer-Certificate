### When you want to run tests on your CSS code you need a linter tool. Why?

- [x] CSS does not handle errors. It just passes through the code and simply ignores the lines that it does not understand. Although VS code will indicate general errors, a linter can help you find any problematic patterns or inefficiencies in your code.
- [ ] CSS linters are only used to pick up syntax errors in your CSS code.
- [ ] CSS indicates all syntax errors and will not execute if you do not run a linter.
